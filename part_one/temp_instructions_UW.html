        You get an initial endowment of <strong>{{ C.ENDOWMENT }}</strong>. Four
        different scenarios will be presented. You will be asked to choose between
        a risky alternative and a safe alternative for each of the four scenarios.
        Your answers are independent of each other. Remember, there are no right
        or wrong answers!

            Additionally, the computer will randomly assign each participant to
            either an <strong>{{ C.E_ROLE }}</strong> or a <strong>{{ C.NE_ROLE }}
            </strong> group. If you are part of the {{ C.E_ROLE }} group, you can
            choose between the risky and the safe alternative. If you are part of
            the {{ C.NE_ROLE }} group, you will have to play the risky lottery.
            Even if you chose the safe option.
        </p>

        You will learn whether you are part of the {{ C.E_ROLE }} or {{ C.NE_ROLE }}
        group after all participants submit their answers. The computer selects
        <strong>one of the scenarios</strong> for your final payoff. You will learn
        the randomly selected scenario and its outcome at the end of the experiment.
        Before starting the experiment, you will have to correctly answer three control
        questions. They ensure that you understood the experiment's rules.

            You should always decide as if your choice will be implemented!
